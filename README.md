# C++ Practice Codes

This folder contains various C++ programs, most of which are focused on loop logic. These codes were written during my Programming Fundamentals course at FAST in my first semester, marking the beginning of my programming journey.

The collection includes examples of:
- 1D arrays
- 2D arrays
- Structs
- Functions
- Loops

Some files contain commented code, while many others are not commented. The collection reflects my early learning and practice with basic programming concepts.
